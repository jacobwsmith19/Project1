<h1>Rise and Shine App</h1>

Use the Rise and Shine app as a "one-stop shop" to easily plan your day. This app is perfect for situations when you're in a hurry in the morning, for example.

Instead of having to access different websites before leaving the house, you can now access the Rise and Shine app to obtain news related to your area, as well as data related to traffic and the weather. You are able to plan ahead what to wear and when to leave your home.

Besides being able to check weather, traffic and news, the Google login feature was also incorporated in the app. If you decide to sign in using this feature, your Google calendar will also be displayed. This way, you can check what meetings or appointments you have scheduled to that day.
