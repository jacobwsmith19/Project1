Rise and Shine

This app can be accessed at https://rise-shine.firebaseapp.com/. It was created in a collaboration between Amanda L. Ragone, Halon J. Hamilton, Jake Smith, Mike Garringer and Troy Fasnacht.

The group created this app as a "one-stop shop" for users to easily plan their day. It's perfect for situations when they're in a hurry in the morning, for example: now, instead of having to access different websites before leaving the house, users can access the Rise and Shine app to obtain news related to their area, as well as data related to traffic and the weather. They are able to plan ahead what to wear and when to leave their homes.

Besides being able to check weather, traffic and news, we also incorporated the Google login feature. If a user decided to sign in using this feature, the user's Google calendar will be displayed. This way, users can check what meetings or appointments they have scheduled to that day.
